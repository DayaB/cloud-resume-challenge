## Cloud Resume Challenge

My resume, hosted on AWS, for the [Cloud Resume Challeng](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) put on by [@ForrestBraezel](https://twitter.com/forrestbrazeal). 

Served by CloudFront and S3. Visitors counted by means of an API gateway and Python Lambda trigger. 

All "serverless", provisioned by CloudFormation, written in Python, Javascript and HTML, tested with unittest and deployed with Github Actions.
